Gold Badge Final Challenges Version 1.0, last commit 11/01/2020

General Usage Notes
  These three applications were made for Komodo. 
    The first is to help their cafe easily create and organize items for their menu.
    The second is to allow better organization of all company outings and the general costs associated with them.
    The third is to help improve efficiency in spending for company barbecues by breaking down each food booth into easily managed statistics.
    
These applications do not need to be installed; they simply need to be cloned.
